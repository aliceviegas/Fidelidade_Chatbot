Fidelidade is a leading insurance provider in portugal. Me and my team developed an integrated AI assistant using Azure Open AI to support their 
agents during client conversations. We implemented custom chunking of internal documents and web scrapping to optimize how the assistant understood 
and retrieved information and we also engineered a detailed prompt to give it context  and to control the tone and structure of the answers. 

Our solution was in the top 4 of the course, and we had the opportunity to presented our solution to the company stakeholders and recieved a 
'best case' award by Fidelidade.
